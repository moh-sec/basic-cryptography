# Cryptography Concepts

Cryptography is the science of protecting information by converting it into a secure format.  
Its primary goals are to ensure **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **authenticity** of data.

## Key Terms

- **Plaintext**: The original message or data that needs to be protected.  
- **Ciphertext**: The encrypted version of plaintext, unreadable without the proper key.  
- **Key**: A secret value used by an algorithm to encrypt or decrypt data.  
- **Algorithm**: A method or procedure used for encryption and decryption.

## Types of Cryptography

1. **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.  
2. **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses a pair of keys—a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt.  
3. **Hashing**: A one-way function that converts data into a fixed-size string (hash). Hashes are commonly used for integrity verification and password storage.

## Other Concepts

- **Encoding**: Converting data into a different format (e.g., Base64) for transmission or storage. Unlike encryption, encoding is reversible without a key.  
- **Attack Models**: Studying potential attacks helps design more secure systems. Examples include brute-force attacks and ciphertext-only attacks.
