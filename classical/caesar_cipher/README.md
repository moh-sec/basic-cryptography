# Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques.  
It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

## Example
- Plaintext: HELLO  
- Key: 3  
- Ciphertext: KHOOR

## How to Use
- Run `caesar.py` to encrypt or decrypt messages.  
- Adjust the key value to see different results.
