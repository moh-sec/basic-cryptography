# Basic Cryptography

This repository started as my personal journey into understanding cryptography.  
While studying, I realized most tutorials show *how to use* cryptographic tools, but rarely explain *how they actually work under the hood*.  
So I decided to build this project to experiment with algorithms, learn by implementing them, and understand their strengths and weaknesses.

> This is an educational project—I’m not aiming for production-level security.

## Goals
- Learn cryptography concepts in a hands-on way
- Implement basic cryptographic algorithms from scratch
- Explore common attacks and why certain designs fail
- Develop a security-aware mindset while coding

## Topics Covered
- Cryptography fundamentals
- Classical (historical) cryptographic algorithms
- Basic modern cryptography concepts
- Hash functions
- Simple attack examples to understand vulnerabilities

## Repository Structure
```
basic-cryptography/
│
├── fundamentals/   # Core concepts and theory
├── classical/      # Classical ciphers and algorithms
├── modern/         # Introduction to modern cryptography
├── attacks/        # Simple attack demonstrations
└── README.md
```

## How to Use
Start with the `fundamentals` folder, read the README files, and run the example code.  
Take notes, tweak the algorithms, and try to break them yourself—that’s the best way to learn!

## Disclaimer
All code here is written **for learning purposes only**.  
Do **NOT** use any implementation in real-world or production environments.  

## Language and Tools
- Language: Python  
- Minimal external libraries; everything is implemented from scratch unless noted otherwise.

I hope you find this project useful and enjoy tinkering with cryptography as much as I did while creating it!
